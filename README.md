# vbaEDA
A vba script to automatically perform some exploratory data analysis on numerical data. For proper functioning of the script your data should be strictly numerical and formatted such that the first row consists of titles for the columns. To run the script, select any cell within the region of the data and run the .bas file. Included in this repo is a sample input and output for the script.
